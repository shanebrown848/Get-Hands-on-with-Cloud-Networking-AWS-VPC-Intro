## Overview

This project introduces core cloud networking concepts using Amazon Web Services. The focus is on understanding how cloud networks work and how AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is used to create secure, isolated network environments in the cloud.

Before cloud networking, organizations relied on physical networking hardware that required manual setup, maintenance, and scaling. Cloud networking replaces this with virtualized, on-demand resources that are faster to deploy and easier to manage.

## What I built

I created the foundation of a cloud network using **Amazon VPC**, which allows AWS resources to run inside a private, logically isolated network. This setup forms the base for future networking components like subnets, routing, and security controls.

## Key concepts learned

- What computer networks are and how they enable communication
- How cloud networking differs from traditional on-prem networks
- What an Amazon VPC is and why it’s used
- Basic network isolation and security concepts in AWS
- How cloud providers abstract physical infrastructure

## Why this project matters

Understanding cloud networking is critical for roles in cloud engineering, DevOps, and cloud security. This project is the first step in a larger AWS networking series and builds the foundation needed for designing secure and scalable cloud architectures.
