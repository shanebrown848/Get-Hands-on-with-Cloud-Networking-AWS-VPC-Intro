## Overview

This project kicks off my AWS Networking Series. The goal is to understand cloud networking fundamentals and start building a cloud networking architecture using AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

In traditional setups, businesses had to buy and maintain physical networking hardware onsite. Cloud networking changes this by providing virtualized networking resources hosted and managed by cloud providers like AWS. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What I’m building

A foundation for a cloud network using **Amazon VPC**, which is a secure, isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can run resources like servers, databases, and applications in a private environment. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Key concepts

### What are networks?
Networks connect computers and devices so they can communicate and share information. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### What is a VPC?
A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is an isolated network environment in AWS that provides:
- Isolation and control
- Security controls (subnets, firewall rules, security groups)
- Custom network architecture (IP ranges, routing)
- Support for hybrid connectivity (connecting to on-prem environments) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why I’m learning this

I’m learning cloud networking to build real networking skills in the cloud, gain hands-on experience designing network architecture, and grow my technical toolkit through a structured 9-project series. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## My plan for finishing the series

I’m setting aside time after work each week to complete the networking projects and stay accountable with a schedule/reminder. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
