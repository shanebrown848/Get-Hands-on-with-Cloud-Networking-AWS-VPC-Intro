## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about Creating my own Virtual Private Cloud. By the end of the 9 projects, I will have gained experience in learning how to build and maintain Networks with in the cloud infastructure. I'm learning about cloud networking because I have always wanted to build my own network via cloud and also it would just be a good experience to have under my tool belt of tech knowledge I already have.

Businesses traditionally had to build and manage their own physical networks — buying servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and maintaining everything onsite. This required significant upfront investment, technical expertise, and ongoing maintenance.

Cloud networking changed things by allowing businesses to move much of their networking infrastructure to cloud service providers. Instead of owning hardware, companies use virtualized network resources hosted in data centers managed by providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside some time after work every week to work on this networking series. I will keep myself accountable by setting up a schedule or alarm reminder on my phone, so I atleast am aware of my current tasks. My reward is feeding my hunger to keep on learning new things.

### What are networks?

Computer networks are a system that connects computers and devices together, helping them communicate and share information. It is essential for us to gain knowledge of how these work because it is how we connect.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a secure, isolated section of a public cloud where organizations can run their resources, like servers, databases, and applications, in a private environment.

This helps organizations by:

Providing isolation and control: Even though it runs on shared infrastructure, each VPC is separated from others, giving businesses their own private space.

Enhancing security: Organizations can define custom firewall rules, subnets, and security groups to control traffic.

Allowing customization: Businesses can design their own network architecture, IP addressing, and routing within the VPC.

Enabling hybrid environments: VPCs can be securely connected to on-premises data centers for hybrid cloud solutions.
